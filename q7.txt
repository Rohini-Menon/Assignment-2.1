7) Can you overload a method with the same return type?Explain your answer with proper logic


 Ans:

     Yes,it is possible to overload a method with the same return type,because during the runtime 

     the compiler inspects the signature of the method or rather the different type of argument list 
     
     inorder to differentiate between the method with the same return type! 
 
 For Example ,

               
               public class Main {

	            public static void main(String[] args) {
		            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
		         System.out.println(sum(2,3));
		         System.out.println(sum(20,30,40));}
		     static int sum(int a,int b)
		  {
			 int z;
		         z=a+b;
			 return z;
		}

		
		
	            static int sum(int a,int b,int c)
		{
			
			int z;
			z=a+b+c;
			return z;
		}
	   }
